Description: Takes an array of IPs and the keys for the services the user wishes to use (IP Hub, IP Intel, and Proxycheck), 
    and passes these to all respective APIs. Returns a dataframe with the IP addresses (used for merging), 
    country, ISP, labels for non-US IP Addresses, VPS use, and recommendations for blocking. The package 
    also provides optional visualization tools for checking the distributions.
