  %abstract = {The authors find that experimental studies using online samples
    %          (e.g., MTurk) often violate the assumption of random assignment,
      %        because participant attrition-quitting a study before completing
        %      it and getting paid-is not only prevalent, but also varies
          %    systemically across experimental conditions. Using standard
   %           social psychology paradigms (e.g., ego-depletion, construal
     %         level), they observed attrition rates ranging from 30\% to 50\%
       %       (Study 1). The authors show that failing to attend to attrition
         %     rates in online panels has grave consequences. By introducing
           %   experimental confounds, unattended attrition misled them to draw
  %            mind-boggling yet false conclusions: that recalling a few happy
    %          events is considerably more effortful than recalling many happy
      %        events, and that imagining applying eyeliner leads to weight loss
        %      (Study 2). In addition, attrition rate misled them to draw a
          %    logical yet false conclusion: that explaining one's view on gun
            %  rights decreases progun sentiment (Study 3). The authors offer a
   %           partial remedy (Study 4) and call for minimizing and reporting
     %         experimental attrition in studies conducted on the Web. (PsycINFO
